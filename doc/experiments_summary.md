166 classes
batch size 32, dense net, convergence , 30 epochs with slooooow convergence (but it is)
batch size 32, single trunk network, convergence is much faster , after 10ep 2.5 % val accuracy already.
batch size 8, single trunk network, convergence is much much faster, after 40ep val acc = 0.28, 
batch size 32, resnet, convergence is very slow again...
batch size 32, single trunk network, convergence is slower, but not too slow, after 40ep val acc = 0.11
